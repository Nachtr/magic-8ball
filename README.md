# Overview
In this project I played around with importing random. 

The goal was to simulate an 8-ball which you shake and it can "tell the future" or so they say. I imported random, and then used an if-statement chain that was == to each number to give the answer. Overall I am happy with this project!

# What Would I add?
In the future, if I were to do it again I would add:
- inputs
- maybe some sort of display or gameify with pygame?
